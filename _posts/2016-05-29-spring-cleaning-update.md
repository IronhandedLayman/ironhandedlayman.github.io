The very first task I tackled was the dotfiles repo. I decided to forage my own road on this, as a learning exercise. It turns out that I got a lot out of being able to make my own dotfiles repo, the biggest hurdle was how to set something up that runs in multiple OSes. It turns out that `uname` is your friend here: it is on most systems and will get you enough of the way there. If you look at [the discussion here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/394230/detect-the-os-from-a-bash-script), there are a lot of opinions on the right way to do this. But it got me enough of the way there to create a structure I can build upon over time.

So far, all I'm copying is my bin folder and a series of conf files. This is good enough for now. I take the victories of what I'm building a little bit at a time.
