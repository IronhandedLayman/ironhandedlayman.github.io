It's a little late for spring cleaning, since it's almost summer. However it needs to happen, and not only for your physical house, but also your digital house. Ask yourself:

* What packages do I have installed on my machine?
* Do I know all my editor's commands?
* Do I have any outstanding tickets on my personal projects?
* Have I updated my websites lately?
* If my dev machine were to croak in 5 minutes, how long would it take to recover?
* How long will it take to get up to speed on a brand new machine?
* Do I have any computer subscriptions that I no longer use that are just wasting money?
* Where do I have accounts on other websites and how long has it been since I changed all my passwords/passphrases?
* Is my email inbox managable?

Some of the actions I'm taking today to clean up my cruft:

* A dotfiles repository. This is a good one to be able to recover one's console setup, and if I do it correctly, it'll also help in recovering my Windows/MacOS/Xwindows setup as well. There are a number of online tutorials such as [this guide on creating a dotfiles repo](https://www.foraker.com/blog/get-your-dotfiles-under-control)
* Creating a list of all websites I currently am aware of having an account under. A good place to start is looking at every app I have installed on my phone.
* Speaking of, reviewing apps on my phone allows me to delete the unused/timewasting/broken apps and reorganize my apps so that my most used apps are on the first page, less common apps either searchable or in folders so that they're easily scanned.
* After I have a list of all of my websites, cycling my passwords is in order. Either use a trusted system to manage _strong_ passwords, or use a password app such as 1Password or LastPass.
* Sometimes it's good to have a fire drill. If I have a trusted dotfiles setup, making sure I have offline storage setup for all of my documents/projects/files is a perfect setup for just completely wiping the machine and starting from a clean slate. If anything this is also good for wiping away any local apps that are no longer used.
* When's the last time I've been to any of these websites? Do I still have a use for them? If not, it's time to remove logins and stop paying subscription fees if any.
* Some of this can be covered by scanning through the email inbox. Almost every website signed up on sends an email upon registration, so searching for "register" or "account" may reveal some forgotten accounts. This is also a good time to unsubscribe to newsletters/mailing lists/advertisements that are usually deleted on a daily basis (or worse, left to clutter the inbox).
* Finally, a good plan for the next development season is in order. What projects will I be working on this summer? What projects am I maintaining that I can no longer mantain and need to pass off? What languages do I need to learn? What languages got rusty that I forgot how to use or no longer have a command of the libraries?

Now, on to it.
