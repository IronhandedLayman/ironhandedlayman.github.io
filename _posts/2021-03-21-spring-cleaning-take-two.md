...and it has been nearly 5 years. Time to clean this thing up. I will keep the previous posts for posterity sake, but I plan to make this a bit more of a long-form posting blog. I think part of it is that I am now a bit more comfortable with what I want to do here, and that is a bit of public project-based learning. What do I mean by this? Well: 

* it will be _public_ in that I will be talking about my side projects here, first off, but also forming a bit of an online presence for my coding side. I will make an effort to update daily.I found that with other endeavours, that updating daily, even if it is just a nod, a reflection that I am keeping the flame going, then I will not abandon the project at hand.
* it will be _project-based_ in that I will not be giving a post about "how to do x" without the context of "in the service of accomplishing y for the project z".
* it will be about _learning_. I will be attempting to do some things that I don't really know how to do. Some of it will be flexing my blogging muscles again. Some of it will be deep in the algorithms, some of it will be organizational, some of it will be (for lack of a better term) meta.

I have new tools, a new base of operations, and a bit of drive. And an incessant need to build my attention span again.

So for my very first project, I will be implementing a static counter. A streak tabulator if you will. When I do a Jekyll build on this site, I will track from this post the number of days I have been able to post daily, and place it on the main page. I will keep a number of counters there, and some stats on how often I have updated my various projects. This project is called [blog-streak-counter]. 

A couple other changes:
* I will be cleaning up the about page and changing the theme. This yellow on dark blue needs to go for readability sake. 
* I will make some other project pages to detail basics of those projects. Will have to mess with GitHub pages to figure that out, but hey, PPBL, right?
* I may make some amateurish philosophy pages. I have to document the inspiration somewhere.

OK. Here we go.
