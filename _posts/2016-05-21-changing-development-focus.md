So, I find that I've been a bit resistant towards learning some of what I have called internally "softer" languages such as Javascript and Ruby. This resistance has been detrimental. The truth is, there are no "soft" languages. All languages that are [Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) are by definition not soft. I am going to be focusing in my job on "softer" languages and usually my personal coding also reflects my work languages. Granted, I'll still be doing some "hard" language coding work but I need to dispense with the paradigm of "soft" and "hard" languages.
