I think I need to distinguish between meta and philosophical posts, as this is going to be a meta post. I do not have an insight, just an observation.

I fell off the horse the last couple of days when work got pretty hard. My main job is very important, but I found myself dedicating too much time on tasks that I was making little progress on. It feels like for me that progress is as much emotional as it is disciplined. In this view, channeling emotion to harness discipline is as important as limiting discipline to protect emotion. I have no evidence for this heuristic, but I try to follow it so as not to be trapped in the waves of procrastination that effect every creator. 

In a way, I feel like there needs to be a balance between being productive towards the myriad of goals you have and respecting your mental, physical, and emotional state. In many ways, this is why I am very focused towards continuing this blog in this manner, to document this balance and the projects that nuture the knowledge arrived from them.

I was not feeling productive this way during the week, but I am trying to gamify this output so that it becomes more consistant. Hence this post, which for most people is skippable since it does not discuss a project or a philosophy but rather puts a marker down where that energy was low and the tactics used to rekindle it, while respecting that the body needs recovery.
