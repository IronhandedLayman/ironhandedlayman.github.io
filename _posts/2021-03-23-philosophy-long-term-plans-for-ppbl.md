This was briefly discussed in the reboot. So this post talks more about the specifics of the projects being addressed:
* The starting projects will be blog-based. I am still learning Jekyll and trying to wire all of this into my workflow so that fighting with the blogging platform doesn't slow down the progress on posting meaningful content. To that end:
	* The counter is important to make sure that I keep this going. Gamification is very important to encourage consistent output. That is the first project I will get to done.
	* Next, improvements to linking. I could use more fancy editors, but I have settled on vim as my primary editor. Thus, addons to vim are the primary path for this, and I could use existing addons, but I feel like I may have to write some bespoke addons and I am looking forward to learning how to do that.
	* Finally, I have a memex idea which I am still thinking through for helping me front-run the research for possible new projects or blog topics.
* The second phase projects will be fun varied projects, and I would like to use them to stretch out my problem-solving skills across various domains. Here are two ideas I have off the top of my head:
	* I would like to write a game that utilizes AI on a creative level, not just on an adversarial level. I have some rough ideas about this, but would like to draft out the ideas first before I start talking about them.
	* I would like to enhance an existing project that I use for pomodoro tracking, removing its existing dependence on Trello and have it point to other open-source alternatives. This is in relation the memex theme I discussed on the blog acceleration above.
* The third phase projects will be dedicated to useful projects. I don't have immediate ideas for this section that I am willing to write about yet. This is because I would like to verify that a tool in this section is _actually_ useful as opposed to just appearing useful. I will talk more about this at length in the near future, as I have done some reading about this very topic. I don't want to make useless tools.
* Finally, I would like to organize the projects and try to update them all on a regular basis. There are of course a number of tools available for this, and while I may lean on one of those solutions, I may also settle on cobbling together my own solution.

Okay, that was enough of a brainstorm. I will go through this post and start extracting projects into their own separate kickoffs. Tomorrow I plan to complete the blog-streak-counter. I did not do that today as I was very busy otherwise for personal and professional reasons.
