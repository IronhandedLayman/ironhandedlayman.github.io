This is just a developer's blog dedicated to public project-driven learning. The details of this PPBL are discussed in the following posts:

* [Spring Cleaning take two]({% post_url 2021-03-21-spring-cleaning-take-two %})


Summarizing the above post is what I have pulled from the idea of PPBL:

* _public_: I will be talking about my side projects here, first off, but also forming a bit of an online presence for my coding side. I will make an effort to update daily.I found that with other endeavours, that updating daily, even if it is just a nod, a reflection that I am keeping the flame going, then I will not abandon the project at hand.
* _project-based_: I will not be giving a post about "how to do x" without the context of "in the service of accomplishing y for the project z".
* _learning_: I will be attempting to do some things that I don't really know how to do. Some of it will be flexing my blogging muscles again. Some of it will be deep in the algorithms, some of it will be organizational, some of it will be (for lack of a better term) meta.
